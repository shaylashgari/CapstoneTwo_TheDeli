# DELI ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
## Description 
#### The Deli Order Management System is a Java-based console application engineered to simulate a comprehensive deli ordering workflow. This system enables users to customize and place sandwich orders, providing a range of configurable options, including bread type, topping selections, drink choices, and chip add-ons. Built with a focus on usability, it supports an efficient, step-by-step ordering process, complete with order summary reviews and automated generation of receipt files for each transaction.

### Below is my diagram for how I have organized my code to execute the coding of this Java-based console application.
